## Getting started

Run the adaptor as a regular web application:

    mvn clean jetty:run-exploded


You can then explore the server starting with its [front page on localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/adaptor-testing/) where you can navigate through its HTML pages, or access its Swagger interface.
